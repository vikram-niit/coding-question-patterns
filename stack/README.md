Evaluate Postfix Expression (RPN)

üìò Problem



Given a list of tokens representing an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation, evaluate it and return the result.



Example

```

Input: \["2", "1", "+", "3", "\*"]

Output: 9

Explanation: ((2 + 1) \* 3) = 9

```



‚öôÔ∏è Approach



Use a stack:



Push operands onto the stack.



On encountering an operator, pop the top two operands, apply the operation, and push the result back.



At the end, the stack‚Äôs only element is the answer.





Code (Python)

```

def evalRPN(tokens):

&nbsp;   stack = \[]

&nbsp;   for token in tokens:

&nbsp;       if token in "+-\*/":

&nbsp;           b, a = stack.pop(), stack.pop()

&nbsp;           if token == '+': stack.append(a + b)

&nbsp;           elif token == '-': stack.append(a - b)

&nbsp;           elif token == '\*': stack.append(a \* b)

&nbsp;           else: stack.append(int(a / b))  # truncate toward zero

&nbsp;       else:

&nbsp;           stack.append(int(token))

&nbsp;   return stack\[0]

```



‚è±Ô∏è Complexity



Time: O(n)



Space: O(n)



üß† Example Run



\["4","13","5","/","+"] ‚Üí 6

‚Üí (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
