# Hashmap (Hashing)

This project demonstrates the usage of **Hashmaps**, a data structure for efficient key-value storage and retrieval with average O(1) operations.

## Features
- Insert, update, delete, and lookup key-value pairs efficiently.
- Handles collisions using built-in Python dictionary.

## Example
```python
hashmap = {}
hashmap['key'] = 'value'
print(hashmap.get('key'))  # Outputs: value
```



## When to use?

Fast lookups, insertions, deletions by key.

Counting frequencies, caching, indexing data.



## Complexity

Average case: O(1) for insert, delete, lookup

Worst case: O(n) (rare, depends on collisions)
